# About

- Recently, I decided to re-learn C++, so here's a stash of code examples and maybe some notes.
- This repository is ongoing, and I hope to fill it up with useful examples for my future self.
- After participating in malware reverse engineering talks, I realized that having knowledge in C, C++, and assembly is valuable.
- My goal is to become proficient in this language and eventually delve into Unix/Linux system programming in the future.
